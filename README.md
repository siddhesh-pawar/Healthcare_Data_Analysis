# Healthcare_Data_Analysis

I conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and characteristics within the dataset. Following this, I implemented machine learning models aimed at predicting hospital readmissions. I evaluated these models' performance using suitable metrics, interpreting the results to identify factors influencing readmissions. Based on this analysis, I provided insights and recommendations to enhance healthcare outcomes and develop strategies for managing diabetes patient readmissions
